# uts_deep_learning_beach_recommender_ai_showcase

This project report focuses on the development of an object detection system for accurately detecting people on crowded beaches, aiming to assist users in finding the best times to visit based on their preferences for crowdedness. With the increasing challenge of locating quiet spots during hot summer days, particularly in major coastal cities like Sydney, a solution was proposed. The system utilizes the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection algorithm to analyze real-time video feeds and accurately count people, enabling the determination of the level of crowding. A web application was developed to integrate with the system, providing real-time recommendations based on current crowding levels. The report includes an introduction, background, dataset overview, architecture, model implementation details, experimental analysis, and a comprehensive discussion on the systemâ€™s performance in detecting people on the beach. It further presents insights into the results, strengths, limitations, potential improvements, and justifications of the choices made throughout the project.
